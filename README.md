**Introduction**

Welcome to the CSV Analysis Chatbot project! This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for analyzing CSV files using a chatbot. The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand user queries and provides relevant results based on the data in the CSV file.

**Project Overview**

The CSV Analysis Chatbot project is built using the following technologies:

* **Gradio**: A Python library for building web-based interfaces for machine learning models.
* **Langchain**: A Python library for building conversational AI models.
* **OpenRouter**: A cloud-based API for NLP tasks.

The project consists of the following components:

* **CSV Chatbot**: A Gradio-based interface for uploading CSV files and interacting with the chatbot.
* **Agent**: A Langchain-based model that uses NLP to understand user queries and provide relevant results.
* **OpenRouter API**: A cloud-based API that provides NLP capabilities for the agent.

**Features**

The CSV Analysis Chatbot project offers the following features:

* **CSV File Upload**: Users can upload CSV files to the chatbot.
* **Natural Language Queries**: Users can ask natural language queries about the data in the CSV file.
* **Relevant Results**: The chatbot provides relevant results based on the user's query.
* **Visualization**: The chatbot can provide visualizations of the data in the CSV file.

**Installation**

To install the CSV Analysis Chatbot project, follow these steps:

### Requirements

* **Python 3.8 or higher**: The project requires Python 3.8 or higher to run.
* **Gradio**: The project requires Gradio to build the web-based interface.
* **Langchain**: The project requires Langchain to build the conversational AI model.
* **OpenRouter API Key**: The project requires an OpenRouter API key to use the NLP capabilities.

### Setup

1. **Install Python**: Install Python 3.8 or higher from the official Python website.
2. **Install Gradio**: Install Gradio using pip: `pip install gradio`.
3. **Install Langchain**: Install Langchain using pip: `pip install langchain`.
4. **Get OpenRouter API Key**: Sign up for an OpenRouter API key on the OpenRouter website.
5. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the CSV Analysis Chatbot repository using Git: `git clone https://github.com/username/csv-analysis-chatbot.git`.
6. **Install Dependencies**: Install the dependencies required by the project using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
